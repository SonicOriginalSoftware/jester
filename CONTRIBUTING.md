# Your Work
- All work should be a feature branch from `dev`
- Make sure to rebase your work on `dev` before opening a PR to merge back into `dev`

# Pull Requests
- Merges should only come by way of PR's
  - Rebase `dev` into `master`
  - Squash feature branches into `dev`
- Only `dev` should be merged into `master` (through a PR)
- `dev` branch will get deleted whenever it is merged into master, just push another `dev` branch that has been rebased on the most recent `master`
